            <p>
              Companies everywhere collect terabytes of logs, but few manage to strike value from them. 
              Instead, log data piles up, overwhelming budgets and teams.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Strike48 allows every company to prospect its data, extract insights, and act on them automatically.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Inspired by the 1848 California Gold Rush, we chose the name Strike48 because we believe 
              a similar rush is waiting inside modern log data.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Our first product, Prospector Studio, is a platform for building AI agents that dig through 
              your logs for actionable gold, just like the prospectors and miners once panned the riverbeds.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              And just like the Gold Rush, we believe Strike48 will open new possibilities across industries â€” 
              from security to compliance, from fraud detection to marketing.
